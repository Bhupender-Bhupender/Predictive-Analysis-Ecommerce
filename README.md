Objective#1: Build a binary classifier to predict whether a product will be recommended for purchase

Methods: 

Following steps are followed:

#1: EDA

#2: Data pre-processing: selecting input/target features, one-hot encoding

#3: Feature selection: pearson correlation, p-value, LassoCV, feature importance from decision trees

#4: Classifiers: Linear (LogisticRegression, LinearSVM), Non-linear (KernelSVM, RandomForest)

#5: Hyper-parameter tuning

#6: Auto-ML for verification

Results: Metrics(Confusion matrix, precision/recall for each class, roc_auc)
